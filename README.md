# UAC - Deep Learning NHF

The Goal of this project is to increase the resolution of low resolution heart MRI scans. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is one of the primary methods of biomedical imaging. For an MRI machine to capture high resolution images longer exposure time is needed. However longer exposure times expose scans to problems like the subject moving during the scan, resulting in a blurry scan. To minimize this risk short exposure times are used, which result in stable, but low resolution scans, leading to the same problem from a different angle. In this project we attempt to use deep learning to create super resolution images of low resolution MRI scans.

For the project we use the ACDC challenge database (https://acdc.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/#challenges)

We have decided to start by using 2 different apraches. In one we use the whole scans and in the other we only use smaller images containing only the hearts.

The network is a 2D convolutional network based on DenseNet. The inputs are the downscaled images and the outputs the upscaled.

To run the training and the evaluation you will need the following python libraries:
- tensorflow
- nibabel
- matplotlib
- gdown
- zipfile36
- opencv-python
- scikit-learn
After all the libraries have been downloaded you will need to clone this repository, open it and download the dataset.
To do that use the following commands:
- cd deep-learning-nhf
- gdown https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1f3_3hflYwVTNU4qCBJ7YK3wnkUoR6YWi&export=download
- gdown https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=18DXZUo5GyeB0xCejjcxidBWPzqTA6XhH&export=download
Once the previous steps ha been done you can begin the preproceccing, training and evaluation.
Use these commands in order:
- python setup.py
- python
- import training
- training.train()
- exit()
- python evaluate.py
